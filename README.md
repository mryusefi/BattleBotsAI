# BattleBotsAI

## Overview  
**BattleBotsAI** is a Unity project that demonstrates the use of **Behavior Trees** to control AI for two bots engaged in a dynamic battle. The project leverages the **Panda.BT** plugin for Behavior Tree implementation, showcasing how this system simplifies AI decision-making through modular and reusable structures.

The project features:
- Bots making decisions based on their environment (e.g., attacking or repositioning).
- Health-based survival logic (using potions or self-destructing).
- A simple yet expandable setup using Behavior Trees.

## What Are Behavior Trees?  
### **Definition**  
A Behavior Tree (BT) is a hierarchical structure used to model decision-making processes in AI. It consists of nodes representing tasks or conditions. These nodes are organized into sequences, fallbacks, and parallel executions, enabling flexible and modular AI design.

### **Benefits of Behavior Trees**  
- **Modularity**: Tasks can be created and reused easily.  
- **Scalability**: Complex behaviors can be broken into simpler components.  
- **Debugging**: Each node's status is easy to visualize, making debugging straightforward.  
- **Flexibility**: Behavior can adapt dynamically to the game state.

### **How Behavior Trees Work**  
- **Nodes**: The fundamental building blocks (actions or conditions).  
- **Control Flow**: The tree traverses nodes based on logic (e.g., sequences or fallback).  
- **Execution**: Each node returns a status (`Success`, `Failure`, or `Running`), dictating the flow of execution.

## How to Implement Behavior Trees in Unity with Panda.BT  
**Panda.BT** is a Unity asset for implementing Behavior Trees directly through scripts or visual representation. It provides a simple syntax for defining trees and tasks.  

### **Key Components of Panda.BT**  
1. **Sequence**:  
   - Executes tasks in order.  
   - If one task fails, the sequence fails.  
   - Example: Aim â†’ Wait â†’ Shoot.  

2. **Fallback**:  
   - Executes tasks in order until one succeeds.  
   - Useful for "plan B" logic.  
   - Example: Attack â†’ Reposition.  

3. **Parallel**:  
   - Executes multiple tasks simultaneously.  
   - Tasks can succeed or fail independently.  
   - Example: Move while Checking for Enemies.

4. **Tasks**:  
   - Custom logic is implemented within nodes (e.g., shooting, moving, checking conditions).

## How This Project Works  

### **Behavior Trees in This Project**
![Bots tree](bots-tree.png)
The project uses two main trees:
1. **Behavior**:  
   - Handles combat and movement decisions.  
   - Subtrees:  
     - **Combat**: Attack and reposition logic when the bot sees an enemy.  
     - **Wonder**: Random movement when no enemy is detected.  

2. **Survival**:  
   - Manages health-based decisions.  
   - Subtrees:  
     - **Use Potion**: Restores health when low.  
     - **Dead**: Explodes when health is critically low.

### **Key Scripts and Logic**  
1. **Combat Logic**:  
   - The bot aims at the target, waits, and shoots in a sequence.  
   - If health declines repeatedly, the bot changes position.

2. **Survival Logic**:  
   - If health is below 40% and a potion is available, it uses a potion.  
   - If health reaches 0, the bot self-destructs.

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mryusefi/BattleBotsAI
2. Open the project in Unity (tested on Unity version XX).
3. Play the scene to see the bots in action.
